## Troubleshooting & FAQs

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Database Connection Error**: Ensure that the `DATABASE_URL` in `application.properties` is correct and the database server is running.
- **Issue Report: PrEP Visit Form Submission Failure**: Sometimes after major modifications, the PrEP Visit form cannot be submitted due to structural issues requiring refactoring. Efforts are underway to address this. Meanwhile, check the validation error object and verify if the patient has eligibility matching the visit date.

### FAQs

- **Q: How do I reset my database?**
  - **A**: Run the database migration script located in the migrations directory.

- **v2.2.1**: Updated dependencies and improved API endpoints.
